I made this brainfuck interpreter hoping to make a robust program I can use to train my interpreter coding skills. I used brainfuck as an initial test so I could build the framework, now I'll probably start using it to make some more complicated interpreters.

The UI is very basic, the main goal was the programming itself.

The interpreter currently only supports loading and saving files.
